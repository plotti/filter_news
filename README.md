# Filter news junk

This script filters the junk news from:

- popular german newspapers: zeit.de, spiegel.de and watson.ch
- and facebook.com and reddit.com

You can define topics via keywords that you don't want to see on this page (e.g. putin, trump, influencer) and then the script finds that dom element that contains this text and simply hides it.

When I started using it I realized how much of a website is news-junk that i am totally not interested in.

Discussion: Obviously the filtering would need to be constantly updated to match the page layout, but with a community of people its not hard to do this, similarly like for adblock lists. I would love to find people who want to turn this script with me into a browser extension that allows people without coding skills to perform this sort of filtering. I also wonder if there are similar projects out there.
